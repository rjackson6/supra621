- 👋 Hi, I’m @supra621
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Django, Rust, and using different combinations of them to solve mechanical and electrical engineering problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and Go, as well as tinkering with embedded devices.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Django projects, especially those which use infrastructure-as-code from which I can learn more about different deployment strategies.
- 📫 I'm not on any form of social media.
